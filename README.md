### Frontend
- **React**: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used to add static typing to the codebase, improving code quality and developer experience.
- **Vite**: Vite is used as the build tool for its fast development server and optimized production builds.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, with custom themes and utility-first CSS classes.
  - Plugins: 
    - `@tailwindcss/typography` for enhanced typography styles.
    - `tailwindcss-animate` for animations.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: The backend is built using Node.js for its asynchronous, event-driven architecture.
- **Express**: Express is used as the web framework to handle routing and middleware.
- **Drizzle ORM**: Drizzle ORM is used for database interactions, providing a type-safe and developer-friendly API.

### Shared Code
- **Shared Schema**: The project includes a shared schema in the `shared/` directory to ensure consistency between the frontend and backend.

### Configuration and Build Tools
- **PostCSS**: PostCSS is used for processing CSS with plugins like Tailwind CSS.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: These tools are used to enforce code quality and formatting standards.
- **TypeScript Config**: A custom `tsconfig.json` is used to define TypeScript compiler options.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `client/`: Contains the frontend code, including React components, hooks, and pages.
- `server/`: Contains the backend code, including routes, storage logic, and server configuration.
- `shared/`: Contains shared code, such as schemas and utilities, used by both the frontend and backend.
